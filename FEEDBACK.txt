FEEDBACK:

-10% late submission.


Good implementation of the findSubset() method.


-0 For future, use more descriptive commit messages, instead of "Does this work?" or "?"
   
   
-0 Why are you creating a class field called masterSet?
    private static ArrayList<Sublist> masterSet = new ArrayList<Sublist>();

   Unless you can justify it classes such as SubsetSum and BubbleSort
   that behave as function objects should not have a static or class field.
   If your implementation relies on these, then these class fields should be
   *initialized* every single time the user call the static methods.
   
   Otherwise, this results in *incorrect* results when *multiple* calls to
   SubsetSum.findSubset(...) is made.
   
   
-0 Incomplete documentation docs generated by Javadocs.
   First, comment your code, especially the new additions to your project,
   in the format required by the Javadocs generator: 
   Then for ease of reference, generate Javadocs based on your documentation.
   For example, instead of:
    /**
     * @param location is path of file to parse
     * @return arraylist that contains doubles
     */
    public ArrayList<Double> readFile(String location){
	{ ... }
	
    Change as follows:
    /**
     * Reads fromâ€¦[user friendly description]    <--- TIP: don't forget the description!
     * @param location is path of file to parse
     * @return arraylist that contains doubles
     */
    public ArrayList<Double> readFile(String location){

    NOTE: An example is provided in Modules titled "Example Program Submission".

    Next time minus two for this.

-Bita.
